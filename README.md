QuickMarks is an analytics app for web projects. It helps you track events on your websites. It is built using Rails, Devise, and a few charting libraries.

Quickmarks analytics offers a few key features:  
- A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website  
- A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database  
- A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user
